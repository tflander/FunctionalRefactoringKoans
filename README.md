# FunctionalRefactoringKoans

Functional programming remains a mystery for many Java developers.  The first mystery is the unfamiliar syntax, but the most 
important mystery is why should I learn functional programming in Java?

These Koans are designed to lead you into resolving both mystries -- from syntax and basic concepts to simplifiying the
solution to multiple programming challenges.

Hopefully you discover that functional programming, done expressivly, is a good way to make your code cleaner and more 
understandable to other developers.
