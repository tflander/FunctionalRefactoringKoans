# FunctionalRefactoringKoans

Functional programming remains a mystery for many Java developers.  The first mystery is the unfamiliar syntax, but the most 
important mystery is why should I learn functional programming in Java?

These Koans are designed to lead you into resolving both mystries -- from syntax and basic concepts to simplifiying the
solution to multiple programming challenges.

Hopefully you discover that functional programming, done expressivly, is a good way to make your code cleaner and more 
understandable to other developers.

Input from Misam Somji:
Hey Yes, I did get around to trying the Java Koans out! I thought it was really interesting and quite helpful. I have been using these patterns for a while now in Java and yet I learnt a few new things that I enjoyed. Here area few things that I think I would add.
Create a README.MD so that it is obvious how to get started. Like run the script etc..I don’t know if that script comes standard with Koans but I knew what koans were but never used the library so hound it difficult to determine how to run the koans.
Couple questions I had while working on the koans themselves :
1. Why and when would need to use Runnable?
2. Why and when would I care about Sam? Why not just use your regular provided interfaces. I think you touch on this later on when talking about being able to throw but maybe expanding on that in the AboutSam could help.
3. I Wasn’t quite sure if what I had was the correct solution CurryingRefactoringPuzzle.java so having a solutions branch would have been helpful


About partial functions:
Though I understand what is going on here and you are trying to prove the point of partial application, it can be very difficult to understand if the syntax. Also, though I bet there is a place for that, I feel that if production code looked like that I would be having a hard time really understand what was going on. Correct me if am wrong, but maybe I would add a note to say that this is a little confusing and though it works, it should probably not be something to pull out from the tool box as the first option.

All together, I loved it! That last challenge was a lot of fun seeing it all come together! I wish there were more exploratory/refactoring koans like the last one and fewer Koans where things started to feel little repetitive.

A solution branch would be helpful to compare if things being done are what you expected. I have mine so if you don’t have one really I can create a PR on the repo.
